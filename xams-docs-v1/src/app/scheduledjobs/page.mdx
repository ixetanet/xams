# Quickstart

Scheduled jobs allow you to execute code at regular intervals or at specific times on designated days. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Create a Scheduled Job

To create a scheduled job, define a new class that is tagged with the `ServiceJob` attribute and implements the `IServiceJob` interface.

```c# {{ title: 'Project.Services / Jobs / MyJob.cs' }}
[ServiceJob("MyJobName", "Primary-Queue", "00:05:00")]
public class MyJob : IServiceJob
{
    public async Task<Response<object?>> Execute(JobServiceContext context)
    {
        var db = context.GetDbContext<DataContext>();
        // Do something
        return ServiceResult.Success();
    }
}
```

The `ServiceJob` attribute takes the following parameters.

- <b>Job Name</b>: The name of the job as it will appear in the Admin Dashboard.
- <b>Queue</b>: A queue executes one job at a time. Multiple jobs can run in
  parallel if they are assigned to different queues.
- <b>TimeSpan</b>: When the JobSchedule is set to interval, this defines the
  time between executions. For example, a TimeSpan of "00:05:00" will trigger
  the job every 5 minutes. When JobSchedule is set to TimeOfDay, this represents
  the specific execution time in UTC. For instance, a TimeSpan of "05:00:00"
  will execute the job at 5:00 AM UTC.
- <b>Job Schedule</b>: Defines when the job runs and can be either Interval or
  TimeOfDay.
- <b>Days of Week</b>: Flags that specify which days of the week the job should
  execute.

## Time of Day Example

Below is an example of a job that executes on Monday and Wednesday at 3:00 AM UTC:

```c# {{ title: 'Project.Services / Jobs / MyJob.cs' }}
[ServiceJob("MyJobName", "Primary-Queue", "00:03:00", JobSchedule.TimeOfDay, DaysOfWeek.Monday | DaysOfWeek.Wednesday)]
public class MyJob : IServiceJob
{
    public async Task<Response<object?>> Execute(JobServiceContext context)
    {
        var db = context.GetDbContext<DataContext>();
        // Do something
        return ServiceResult.Success();
    }
}
```
