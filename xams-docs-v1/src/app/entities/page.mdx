# Entities

Entity definitions need to follow certain rules in order to work with Xams. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Entity Rules

1. Entities should have either a string Name field or a string field with the attribute UIName for lookup fields.
2. Composite Primary Keys are not supported.

## Cascade Delete

Configure cascade delete using the nullable operator `?` and the `CascadeDelete` attribute.


```c# {{ title: 'Project.Common / Entities / Widget.cs' }}
[Table("Widget")]
public class Widget : BaseRecord
{
    public Guid WidgetId { get; set; }

    // Name is not nullable and required
    public string Name { get; set; }

    // Company is not nullable making it required 
    // Deleting the Company deletes this record
    public Guid CompanyId { get; set; }
    public Department Company { get; set; }

    // Manufacturer is nullable making it optional
    // Deleting the Manufacturer sets this to null
    public Guid? ManufacturerId { get; set; }
    public Manufacturer? Manufacturer { get; set; }

    // Contact is nullable but the UIRequired attribute makes it required
    // Deleting the contact sets this to null
    [UIRequired]
    public Guid? ContactId { get; set; }
    public Contact Contact { get; set; }

    // Address is nullable making it optional
    // The CascadeDelete attribute deletes this
    // record when the Address is deleted
    [CascadeDelete]
    public Guid? AddressId { get; set; }
    public Address Address { get; set; }
}
```

<Note>
  When a user deletes a record, delete permissions are checked only on the record being deletedâ€”not on any dependent records removed through cascading.
This behavior is consistent with how enterprise CRM systems operate.
