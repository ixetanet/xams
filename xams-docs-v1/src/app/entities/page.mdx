# Entities

Entity definitions need to follow certain rules in order to work with Xams. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Entity Rules

1. Entities should have either a string Name field or a string field with the attribute UIName for lookup fields.
2. Composite Primary Keys are not supported.
3. See [React Data Types](/react_guide#react-data-types) for fields types that are compaitabile with the React components.

## Cascade Delete

If a relationship is defined as non-nullable, it becomes required and will be deleted if the related record is removed. To prevent cascade deletion, the relationship can be made nullable.

You can still make the field required by using the [UIRequired](/attributes#ui-required) attribute.

```c# {{ title: 'Project.Common / Entities / Widget.cs' }}
[Table("Widget")]
public class Widget : BaseRecord
{
    public Guid WidgetId { get; set; }
    // Name is required
    public string Name { get; set; }

    // Company is required, cascade delete will delete this record
    public Guid CompanyId { get; set; }
    public Department Company { get; set; }

    // Manufacturer is nullable, cascade delete will set this to null
    public Guid? ManufacturerId { get; set; }
    public Manufacturer? Manufacturer { get; set; }

    // Contact is nullable, cascade delete will set this to null
    // but upon create & update it's always required
    [UIRequired]
    public Guid? ContactId { get; set; }
    public Contact Contact { get; set; }

}
```
