# Security

Security is configured in the Admin Dashboard by using Teams, Roles, and Permissions. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Schema

The diagram below shows the relationships between the security entities. Users are assigned to Teams, while Roles can be assigned to both Teams and Users. Permissions are assigned to Roles.

## Permissions

Permissions for Roles can be configured from the Admin Dashboard under Security -> Roles. Permissions assigned to Users are additive, meaning they accumulate from multiple roles.
