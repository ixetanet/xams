# Entities

Entity definitions need to follow certain rules in order to work with Xams. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Release Mode

Building in release mode can dramatically increase performance.

## Batches

Sending data in batches can increase performance.

Entities with no service logic will hault saving until they've all been added to the change tracker.

## Service logic

Favor PreValidation and PreOperation service logic whenever possible. This reduces the amount of calls to the database.
