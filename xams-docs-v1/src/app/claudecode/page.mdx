# Claude Code

Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI that provides intelligent assistance for software development tasks. When working with Xams projects, you can optimize Claude Code to understand your specific project context and provide more accurate assistance. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Initial Setup

Before setting up Claude Code for your Xams project, you need to copy the framework documentation from the main Xams repository.

### 1. Copy Framework Documentation

First, copy the `CLAUDE.md` file and `.claude` folder from the main Xams repository to your project:

```bash {{ title: 'Terminal' }}
# Navigate to your project directory
cd your-xams-project

# Copy CLAUDE.md from the Xams repository
curl -o CLAUDE.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ixetanet/xams/main/CLAUDE.md

# Create .claude directory and copy framework documentation
mkdir -p .claude
curl -o .claude/architecture.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ixetanet/xams/main/.claude/architecture.md
curl -o .claude/components.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ixetanet/xams/main/.claude/components.md
curl -o .claude/workflows.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ixetanet/xams/main/.claude/workflows.md
curl -o .claude/reference.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ixetanet/xams/main/.claude/reference.md
```

<Note>
  The framework documentation provides Claude Code with essential knowledge about Xams architecture, patterns, and best practices. This ensures consistent development approaches across your project.
</Note>

### 2. Install Claude Code

If you haven't already installed Claude Code, follow the installation instructions from the [official documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

## Project Memory Bank Optimization

Once you have the framework documentation in place, use the following prompt to have Claude Code analyze your project and create optimized project-specific documentation.

### Update Memory Bank Prompt

Copy and paste this prompt into Claude Code, replacing the placeholder information with your specific project details:

```markdown {{ title: 'Claude Code Prompt' }}
# Update Memory Bank

Please analyze my current Xams project and update the memory bank with what you find. Scan the codebase to understand what I've built so far and create/update documentation that will help you assist me better in the future.

**My Project:** [Brief description of what you're building - 1-2 sentences]

**Current Focus:** [What you're working on now or what you want to work on next]

---

**Instructions for Claude:** 

1. **Scan the codebase** to identify:
   - Any README.md files and their contents
   - Custom entities and their relationships
   - Service logic classes and what they do
   - Custom actions that have been implemented
   - UI customizations or special components
   - Any integrations or external dependencies

2. **Update CLAUDE.md** to include:
   - Project summary and current state
   - Key entities and their purposes
   - Important business rules discovered
   - Development status and priorities

3. **Create/update .claude files:**
   - `.claude/project-status.md` - Current implementation status, what's built vs planned
   - `.claude/entities-reference.md` - Entity definitions, relationships, and business rules
   - `.claude/custom-implementations.md` - Service logic, actions, and customizations
   - `.claude/development-notes.md` - Technical decisions, patterns used, areas for improvement

4. **Track for future updates:**
   - New entities as they're created
   - Service logic implementations
   - Custom actions and workflows
   - UI patterns and components
   - Integration points
   - Performance considerations
   - Testing approaches

Focus on documenting what exists now and creating a foundation for tracking future development. Ask clarifying questions only if you can't determine something from the codebase analysis.
```

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the prompt:

```markdown {{ title: 'Example' }}
# Update Memory Bank

Please analyze my current Xams project and update the memory bank with what you find. Scan the codebase to understand what I've built so far and create/update documentation that will help you assist me better in the future.

**My Project:** Building an e-commerce platform with product catalog, customer management, and order processing using Xams framework.

**Current Focus:** Working on implementing the checkout workflow and payment integration features.
```

## Ongoing Memory Bank Updates

As your project evolves, regularly update the memory bank by simply prompting:

```markdown {{ title: 'Quick Update Prompt' }}
update memory bank
```

Claude Code will:
- Scan for new entities, service logic, and custom implementations
- Update existing documentation with recent changes
- Track new patterns and architectural decisions
- Maintain current project status and priorities

## Benefits of Optimized Memory Bank

With a properly configured memory bank, Claude Code will:

- **Understand your domain**: Recognize your specific entities and business rules
- **Follow your patterns**: Maintain consistency with existing code styles and conventions
- **Suggest relevant solutions**: Provide context-aware recommendations based on your project structure
- **Track progress**: Remember what's been implemented and what's planned
- **Accelerate development**: Reduce time spent explaining project context for each request

## Best Practices

1. **Initial Setup**: Always run the memory bank update immediately after copying the framework documentation
2. **Regular Updates**: Update the memory bank weekly or after major feature implementations
3. **Be Specific**: Provide clear project descriptions and current focus areas
4. **Review Generated Docs**: Periodically review the `.claude/` files to ensure accuracy
5. **Version Control**: Include the `.claude/` directory in your repository to share context with your team

## Troubleshooting

**Claude Code doesn't understand Xams patterns:**
- Ensure you've copied the framework documentation from the main repository
- Run the memory bank update prompt to refresh project context

**Generated documentation is incomplete:**
- Provide more specific details in your project description
- Manually review and update the `.claude/` files as needed
- Re-run the memory bank update with additional context

**Team synchronization issues:**
- Commit the `.claude/` directory to version control
- Have team members run "update memory bank" after pulling changes
- Establish a process for updating documentation alongside code changes
